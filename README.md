# Landing Kickstarter

## Description

The Landing Kickstarter was created using various technologies including HTML, CSS, BEM, JavaScript, Vanilla JS, SASS preprocessors, and the Flickity slider-carousel.

This landing page is responsive to different screen sizes and was designed with a mobile-first approach. It features a stylish design, including a burger menu (on the mobile version), scrolling functionality, an adaptive slider-carousel (on mobile and tablet screens), links, and a form for user input.
